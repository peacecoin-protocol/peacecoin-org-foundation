## What is Community Currency?

Community currency is a currency system used exclusively within a specific community, region, or organization.
It is designed to energize the local economy and strengthen relationships among community members.
Unlike traditional fiat currencies, community currencies are customized to meet specific community needs, facilitating the exchange of goods and services.

## Challenges in Operating Community Currencies

Introducing a community currency involves numerous challenges.
Factors such as currency design, ensuring its value, establishing a distribution system, recruiting participants, and legal frameworks must all be carefully considered.
Additionally, significant effort is required to build trust among community members and manage ongoing operations after the currency's launch.
These challenges often become major obstacles for communities attempting to create their own currency.

## What PEACE COIN Enables

PEACE COIN offers an innovative solution to overcome these challenges.
Through this platform, designing, issuing, and managing community currencies become accessible to everyone.

PEACE COIN's technology uses blockchain to ensure secure and transparent transactions.
Furthermore, the market-traded PEACE COIN (PCE), which serves as the foundation for community currencies, guarantees their value.
This creates a trusted environment for users.
Additionally, PEACE COIN allows customization for various communities, organizations, and projects.
In this way, PEACE COIN contributes to community development through the widespread adoption and utilization of community currencies.
