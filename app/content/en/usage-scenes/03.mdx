## What Is Unpaid Work?

Unpaid work refers to labor that does not receive a salary or direct monetary compensation.
This includes household chores, childcare, caregiving, and volunteer activities.
Although these tasks do not generate direct economic value, they play an essential role in societal functioning and individual well‑being.
Unpaid work strengthens family and community bonds and provides the foundation for improving overall quality of life.

## The Significance of Rewarding Unpaid Work

Providing rewards for unpaid work recognizes its value and offers a way to acknowledge the contributions of those who perform it.
Traditional economic systems struggle to offer direct compensation for unpaid work.
Rewarding unpaid work means acknowledging its social and economic worth and supporting the people who perform these tasks.
By doing so, household chores, caregiving, and other unpaid activities can develop into a viable economic sphere, ultimately improving people’s quality of life.
